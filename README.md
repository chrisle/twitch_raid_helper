Simple bot that when you're raided, it will tell the chat to refresh thier
browsers like this:

It will repeat that message every 3 minutes and then stop after 15 minutes.

## Instructions:

I'm gonna assume you have Node JS and know a little about how to use it.

1. Install the libraries with "npm i"

2. Create an OAUTH password
    - Login to Twitch then in another tab go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
    - It will give you a special password for your bot.

3. Paste the special password below.

4. Type in the channels you want to have this bot running.

5. Edit how you want the bot repeat when it's raided

6. Run the bot using "node index.js"
